# Chatbot-Jeffey
A basic chatbot with over 80,000 questions and answers


The training file containing the database was too large to upload to the github, so it is not included here.
To show the chatbot runnning with the database I attached a youtube link below:

For some reason, the bot cannot be heard in the video. The long pauses are the bot reading out the response.

Also, there is an issue where the bot spots processing requests after the second recognizable request. I think it has something to do with Google's speech-to-text engine
but I could not find any fix for it.
